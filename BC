Border Conflict is a FPS game i am currently making in Godot.
BC will take place in the country of Jited, you will be playing as an American Soldier whos plane crash landed in the capital of Jited.

Vehicles

In BC you will utilise vehicles such as: Cars, Planes and even motorcycles.

Weaponry

You won't have that many guns in BC. The weapons we have planned to add (and are currently implementing) are the:
1911
AK47
MK18
M870
MP5
and a KSG tactical shotgun.
These weapons won't be called.. well these in the finished game for legal reasons.


And that's everything i have to say about Border Conflict for now.
